# Headphones Webpage Project

This project is part of my ALX Front-End Web Development training. It involves building a responsive **Headphones landing page** based on a provided Figma design.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this task is to accurately recreate a web page from a Figma file, ensuring pixel-perfect implementation while maintaining responsiveness and proper interactions.

## 🎨 Figma Design
- Create a Figma account and open the project link provided in the task.
- Click **"Duplicate to your Drafts"** to access all design details.
- If your computer doesn’t have the fonts used, install:
  - **Source Sans Pro**
  - **Spin Cycle OT**
- Some values may appear as floats — rounding them is acceptable.

## 📱 Responsiveness
The webpage must switch to the **mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less**.

## 🖱️ Interactions
- **Links (hover/active):** `#FF6565`
- **Button (hover/active):** `opacity: 0.9`

## 📐 Layout Requirements
- Maximum content width: **1000px**
- Content must be **centered** on the page.
